   <h3>Biography</h3>

    <p>I am a senior at CUNY Hunter College working to enter the media field as a Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_localization" target="_blank">video game localization specialist</a>. I have seriously studied Japanese for 
        three years and had the opportunity to study at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, Japan last summer. In my free time, I like to play games (of course!), run in Central Park, play with my dog, and explore the city with my girlfriend.

    <h3>Artist Statement</h3>

        <p>
            Cultural expression satiates the human need to create and intellectual desire to understand. People extend their intimate feelings to the world through infinitely diverse means - literature, music, and digital media to name a few. 
            Creating a supportive environment for people of all backgrounds to celebrate each other's art is my driving force. In this web development course, I aim to learn the fundamental skills for creating such a space.
